Innovation is deeply influenced by the resources and opportunities available to individuals. Key factors such as gender, family income, geography, and access to education can determine who has the chance to turn their ideas into reality. Understanding these influences is important to make informed decisions about a childâ€™s upbringing and to provide children with the support and encouragement needed to spark creativity and drive innovation.",
